# recursive-descent-arithmetic-expression-parser-in-HASKELL
## features
- reads a file then prints the mathimatical results
- follows PEMDAS or in this case PMDAS
- can follow parenthesis patterns correctly
- can do the operations `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- written in haskell (after rust for so much time the language is a feature)
- has a lexer (most projects this size dont and just skip that but I wanted more practice in language design)
- only does integers and follows integer division rules
## about 
it is a recursive descent arithmetic expression parser with a lexer that is written in haskell (woah fp), this is my first time working with a fully functional language and this is my first project, I just started learning 2 days ago and decided to allocate 2 hours for this. If you are still reading this I highly highly recomend learning haskell and this is by base project in any language to test myself, I usually do this after 5 hours spent of learning but this time around 2, and one day later.
