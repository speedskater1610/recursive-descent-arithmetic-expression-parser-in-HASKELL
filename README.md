# recursive-descent-arithmetic-expression-parser-in-HASKELL
it is a recursive descent arithmetic expression parser with a lexer that is written in haskell (woah fp), this is my first time working with a fully functional language and this is my first project, I just started learning 2 days ago and decided to allocate 2 hours for this. If you are still reading this I highly highly recomend learning haskell and this is by base project in any language to test myself, I usually do this after 5 hours spent of learning but this time around 2, and one day later.
